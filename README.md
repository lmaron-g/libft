# Libft

This is my handmade C library.

Here you can find functions for working with `strings`, `memory`, `output` etc.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:lmaron-g/libft.git; cd libft; make
```

## Run

You have to compile your `SRC files` with `./libft/libft.a`

Also you have to include `#include "libft.h"` in your code.
