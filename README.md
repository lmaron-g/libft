# Libft

This is my handmade C library.

Here you can find functions for working with `strings`, `memory`, `output` etc.


## Installation

Clone or download this repo and place it in the workspase folder.

Go to Lift directory and `make` it.


## Run

You have to compile your main.c with `./lift/lift.a`

Also you have to include `"./lift/libft.h"` in your code.
